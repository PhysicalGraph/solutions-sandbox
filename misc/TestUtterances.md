# Test Utterances to try in the service simulator
Based on the user stories described in confluence: https://smartthings.atlassian.net/wiki/display/AZ/Amazon+Locks+Custom+Skill

## Setup

### Devices
* multiple physical or simulated locks, named with standard names
 * __Test Lock__
 * __Front Lock__
 * __Back Lock__
 * __Entry Lock__

* Special case No. 1
 * __Jammed Lock__
   * physical deadbolt which can be put into a jammed or unknown state and reflects this in the DTH
   * simulated lock which can be set to a jammed state 'jammed'

* Special case No. 2
 * __Null Lock__
   * simulated lock DTH with lock attribute set to a null state to test SA robustness

* Special case No. 3
 * __Unknown Lock__
   * No actual device configured a.k.a. it doesn't exist

For simulated devices, the Simulated Jammable Lock DTH included in this repository will help as it can easily be set to the necessary states

Watch word: the simulator is fine with Alexa regardless of your config in the Alexa app.
